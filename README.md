# GameServer
Basic number guessing game in Java using a client/server connection. Server runs the game by creating a random number 
and asking the client to guess the correct number. Client can be ran simultaneously by the server 'passing' a thread. The
client gets a limited number of guesses before the game is over. Once the game is over, the server tells the client their 
score and asks them if they would like to play again or disconnect and exit the game.
